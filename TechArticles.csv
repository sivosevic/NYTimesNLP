791,Technology,"HUNDREDS of disputes are in progress over who owns valuable business domain names on the Internet -- those ubiquitous ""acme.com"" identifiers for E-mail addresses and corporate Web sites. This long-brewing controversy has pitted owners of domain names afraid of losing their names against trademark owners who contend that their marks are being compromised. And both sides now are clamoring for someone to do something. Someone, in this case, is Internic, an organization serving as the registry for the most recognized categories of Internet domains: .com, for commercial enterprises; .edu, for educational institutions; .net, for organizations that run networks, and .org, for research and nonprofit groups. Internic has registered some 400,000 names in these domains, first-come, first-served, since it was founded in 1993 through an arrangement with the federally backed National Science Foundation.          Last year Internic began charging registrants $50 a year for each name registered. Previously, Internet name disputes were rare and, invariably, had been settled cooperatively. But as commercial interest in the Internet increased, domain-name speculators and trademark lawyers descended like locusts. Speculators staked out names of well-known companies and products and began selling them back to the companies themselves. Trademark holders began sending threats to holders of domain names that came close to, or matched, their trademarks. If the domain holders didn't relinquish, the trademark owners often  would sue -- even if the trademark was for Acme Plumbing, say, and the registered name holder's business, Acme Bakery, was unrelated. And if threats didn't work, many trademark holders were also happy to threaten Internic. ""Their lawyers say, 'We'll sue everyone, including you,' "" said Grant  Clark, corporate counsel for the Science Applications International Corporation, which owns Internic and the company that operates it, Network Solutions Inc. According to Internic, such threats have forced it to assume that it will be sued in such circumstances -- despite the fact that Internic lawyers say it has  never performed, nor does it intend to, any kind of trademark search or verification before issuing a domain name. To deflect some of its perceived liability, Internic adopted a name-dispute policy that appears to favor trademark holders. The policy so infuriated holders of existing domain names that the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a public policy group, is actively seeking pro bono counsel to file a class action suit against both Network Solutions Inc. and the Federal Government. It's not clear how much of an effect such a suit might have. Although Internic's name registry was formed with the blessing of the National Science Foundation, Internic has no known legal authority. It was given its responsibility by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority, a clearinghouse chartered by the influential Internet Society and the Federal Network Council to coordinate how domain names are linked to the physical locations of computers on the global network. In any event, one worrisome feature for groups like the Electronic Frontier Foundation is a contract that Internic requires domain-name applicants to sign.  The contract says they must agree not to sue Internic over a name dispute. And in the event of a dispute, they must post a bond to cover Internic's legal fees. The amount of the bond, according to a lawyer for Network Solutions, could be little or nothing if the company is not named in the suit, though if the company is named, it would be higher. Another concern is that Internic overwhelmingly favors trademark owners over those with registered domain names. A trademark holder must simply inform Internic of a registered trademark that predates the registration of an Internet domain name and contend that the duplication is causing confusion or harm. These two conditions are sufficient grounds for Internic to start a dispute proceeding against the existing holder of the domain name. At the end of 30 days, the name ""goes dark,"" or is taken off the network pending an agreement between the name holder and the trademark owner. Going dark, of course, could put a network provider, or anyone who conducts business on the Internet, out of business overnight. One such unresolved dispute involves the domain name ""sylvan.com,"" registered with Internic by Kayvan Sylvan, a software consultant. His domain name is being  challenged by Sylvan Learning Systems Inc., which sells franchised educational services. If Mr. Sylvan and the company are unable to settle the dispute in the allotted time, Internic will take the ""sylvan.com"" address off the Internet until the matter is finally resolved. Internic contends that its only alternative would be the dubious one of waiting for Sylvan Learning to slap it with a lawsuit for contributing to a trademark infringement. The logical solution to this industry problem would be to indemnify Internic from trademark liability so that name disputes could be settled directly between the parties involved, through existing trademark law. Such legal protection would have to come from the Federal Communications Commission or from Congress.  Mr. Clark, the lawyer for Internic's corporate parent, said he would be ""ecstatic"" if Congress granted his organization immunity from lawsuits accusing  it of contributing to trademark infringement. ""It would put an end to the need for the dispute policy,"" he said. Even Internic's biggest detractors agree. By whatever means, ""Internic needs to  get out of the business of deciding who will have their domain name taken away,"" says Carl Oppedahl, a lawyer who had sued Internic on behalf of clients who wanted to challenge its dispute policy. ""If a trademark owner doesn't like a domain name, it should go to the courts. Existing trademark law applies to the Internet, just like it does to toothpaste brands in stores.""         "

831,Technology Briefing | Patents: Symbol Technologies Sues Intermec,"Symbol Technologies said yesterday that it had sued Intermec Technologies for infringing on two bar code patents, expanding a dispute that broke out last year over Intermec's claims of fundamental patent rights in the fast-growing business of using radio tags to identify products. The legal wrangling began last summer when Intermec sued Matrics, a start-up manufacturer of radio tags and scanners that balked at paying licensing fees to Intermec. Symbol acquired Matrics last July and in March, when efforts to negotiate a settlement broke down, filed a suit charging Intermec with violating Symbol's Wi-Fi patents. Intermec responded with further patent infringement claims against Symbol. The battle is the first major intellectual property dispute in the field of radio frequency identification, or RFID. Specialists say the outcome could affect how fast the field develops and who profits from it.   Barnaby J. Feder (NYT)  "

The acquisition price represents an 89.2 percent premium, based on Numerical's closing price of $3.70 a share on Friday. Shares of Numerical, which is based in San Jose, Calif., closed yesterday at $6.91, up $3.21, or about 87 percent. Chip-making companies use Numerical's software and other applications to produce integrated circuits with patterns that are smaller than the wavelength of light. Numerical's applications are based on phase-shifting and optical correction technologies that compensate for distortions caused by working in such reduced dimensions. Synopsys, which is based in Mountain View, Calif., makes electronic design automation software. The company expects the deal to speed production of sub-wavelength chips as well as reduce costs and manufacturing risk for customers developing power-efficient integrated circuits. The acquisition requires regulatory approval and other closing conditions.

Revenue fell 13.2 percent from a year ago, to $3.80 billion, excluding revenue from the QwestDex directories business that Qwest is selling. The decline will be reported later in a final filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission as just under 10 percent once Qwest completes a restatement of 2001 revenue. Qwest has said that the 2001 quarter's revenue were inflated by improper accounting of sales of capacity on its optical network. No matter which figures are used, they add up to continued weakness and Qwest said that revenue for the year would end up at the low end of the range it previously projected. But Qwest's operating units did manage to generate $53 million more cash than they used by cutting costs and capital spending.   Barnaby J.

Senator Hatch, a Utah Republican who will be chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee on Jan. 20, made his remarks at the opening of a conference sponsored by the Coalition for the Future of Music. About 400 recording artists, technologists, record executives and lawyers gathered at Georgetown University for the two-day event to discuss how the Internet is affecting the creation and dissemination of music. The traditional record industry has been criticized for being slow to offer music online and to provide affordable licenses to Internet companies that are seeking to do so. Senator Hatch, who presided over hearings on the subject last spring, noted that some creative business alliances have since been struck. But he continued to raise the specter of regulation.

1178,Technology Briefing,"INTERNET ERROR DOWNS SEVERAL MICROSOFT SITES Microsoft took most of the day yesterday to fix ""an operational error"" that shut out millions of users from its group of Web sites starting Tuesday night. Sites including Microsoft.com, MSN.com, MSNBC.com, WindowsMedia.com, Expedia.com and Carpoint.com were unavailable nearly 24 hours. The problem also crippled some of the company's European Web sites. Adam Sohn, a Microsoft spokesman, attributed the problem to an incorrect configuration change by a Microsoft technician. The problem limited access to the domain name system, or D.N.S., server, which translates a domain name into a numerical Internet address. ""This was an operational error,"" the company said in a statement, ""and not the result of any issue with Microsoft or third-party products nor the security of our networks."" Earlier, a spokesman ruled out a denial-of-service attack, in which a malicious computer program sends thousands of requests for information to a site, swamping the servers.    Chris Gaither (NYT)"

From a Japanese perspective the answers make sense because, historically, environmental problems, or

Jim Whitney, a spokesman for AOL Time Warner, declined to comment, but Wall Street analysts and some employees said they expected layoffs to begin this week. The cuts would be the second major round of layoffs this year at the company, the world's largest Internet and media company. The company cut about 2,400 jobs in January.
